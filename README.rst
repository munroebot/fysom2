fysom2 - More pythonic fysom
============================

What is fysom2?
---------------

fysom2 is a Python implementation of `finate state machine<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine>`_.
Inspired by `javascript-state-machine<https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine>`_,
Mansour Behabadi ported it to python which becomes the original fysom project,
then Maximilien Riehl fork and enhance it with unitests and coverage statistic,
make it reliable and accessable on pypi. And finally, this one is the successor
of all the three projects above.


Why bother another fork?
------------------------

As is mentioned, Mansour Behabadi's fork looks good enough to use,
why bother another one? Well, as a religious Pythonista, a simply direct port
of javascript is far beyond "good enough" to me, code should not only be useable,
but also readable and follows the design concept of its language well.
From that point of view I will refactor the code and make it more Pythonic
to use and read.
